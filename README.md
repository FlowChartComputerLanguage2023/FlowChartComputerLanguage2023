### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**FlowChartComputerLanguage2023/FlowChartComputerLanguage2023** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a program to input & output source code to a editable flow chart.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on handing this over to others, 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with debugging, testing, distributing (because it has gotten to big a project to finish by myself)
